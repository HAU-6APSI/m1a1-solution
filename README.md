# Module 1 – Activity 1 – Hello World

Your first activity. Print a message to the console and fill in your details.

## What to do

### 1. Fill in your details

Open `student.json` and fill in every field:

```json
{
  "classCode": "1234",
  "fullName": "Juan Dela Cruz",
  "studentNumber": "2026-12345",
  "studentEmail": "juan.delacruz@hau.edu.ph",
  "personalEmail": "juan@example.com",
  "githubAccount": "juandelacruz"
}
```

Use the **class code** your instructor gave you (it also appears in your repo
name, e.g. `m1a1-1234-yourname`). This file **is** committed to your repo
(unlike a `.env`), so the tests can read it. Don't put passwords or secrets here.

> **Keep `student.json` identical across all your activities.** The autograder
> cross-checks these fields between your repos, and a mismatch (e.g. a different
> `classCode` in one activity) is flagged. The `classCode` must also match the
> one in your repo name.

### 2. Write the Hello World

Open [`hello.js`](hello.js) and make it print exactly:

```
Hello, World!
```

to the console using `console.log`.

## Set up your repo

Before you write any code, create **your own copy** of this activity from the
template. Do not work in the template itself.

1. **Create from the template.** Open the template repo and click
   **Use this template → Create a new repository**.
2. **Set the owner to the course org.** Under *Owner*, choose the **`HAU-6APSI`
   course org**, **not** your personal account.
3. **Name it by the convention** `m<module>a<activity>-<classcode>-<yourname>`.
   For this activity that's **`m1a1-<classcode>-yourname`** (e.g.
   `m1a1-1234-juandelacruz`). The `<classcode>` must match the one you put in
   `student.json`.
4. **Make it Private.** Set *Visibility* to **Private** so classmates can't see
   your work.

Then clone **your** new repo and work there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HAU-6APSI/m1a1-<classcode>-yourname.git
cd m1a1-<classcode>-yourname
```

## Running the tests

Install dependencies once:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

All tests must pass:

- ✅ `hello.js` prints `Hello, World!` to the console
- ✅ All six fields in `student.json` are filled in

## Confirm your submission

Your repo **is** your submission, so there is nothing to upload anywhere.
**Pushing your work is how you submit it.** When your tests pass locally,
**commit and push**:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Activity 1 complete"
git push
```

Pushing triggers the **Autograde** workflow on GitHub. Confirm your submission
landed:

1. Open your repo on GitHub and click the **Actions** tab.
2. Open the latest **Autograde** run and confirm the green ✅ check
   and the "7 / 7 tests passed" summary.
